## LinkedList
This directory contains implementations and problems related to linked lists. Common operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal are included.

## Recursion
Here you will find solutions to problems that are solved using recursive techniques. This includes base cases and recursive calls.

## Array
This section covers various array-related problems and their solutions, including operations like searching, sorting, and manipulation.

## Backtracking
Contains problems and solutions that use backtracking, a technique for solving problems incrementally, by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they are not suitable.

## Binary Search Tree
Implements binary search trees (BST) and includes operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, along with traversal techniques.

## Binary Tree
Focuses on binary tree structures, including traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and various binary tree operations.

## Bit Masking
Includes problems and solutions that use bit manipulation techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Dynamic Programming
Provides solutions to problems using dynamic programming techniques, breaking problems down into simpler subproblems and solving them efficiently.

## Graphs
Contains implementations of graph algorithms including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and others.

## Greedy
Focuses on greedy algorithms, which make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

## Heap
Includes implementations of heap data structures and related algorithms, such as heap sort and priority queues.

## Maths
Contains mathematical algorithms and problems, such as prime number generation, greatest common divisors (GCD), and more.

## Matrix
Focuses on matrix-related problems and solutions, including matrix traversal and manipulation.

## Miscellaneous
A collection of various algorithms and data structures that do not fit into the other specific categories.

## Searching and Sorting
Includes various searching and sorting algorithms, from basic ones like binary search and quicksort to more complex algorithms.

## Stack and Queue
Implements stack and queue data structures and their associated operations, including various problems related to these structures.

## Strings
Contains problems and solutions related to string manipulation, such as pattern matching, string searching algorithms, and more.
